        <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
        <hr>
        
        <p>
            An Electrician/Open Cabling technician with extensive experience in the installation, 
            termination and testing of data networks. I've worked closedly with IT teams durning 
            testing and commissioning, which was the motivator to transition from installation of 
            network cabling and infrastructure to the operational side of IT. When in the position
            to be able, I commenced a Bachelor of Science (Cyber Security), which I completed in 
            July 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose to focus on Cyber Security due to the ever-increasing number of cyberattacks, 
            and the negative impacts they are having on every-day Australians. I believe Cyber 
            Security is essential in curbing that rise, and i want to play my part in mitigating 
            the harm cyber-criminals cause their victims.
